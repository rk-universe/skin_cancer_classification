# Skin Cancer Classification Model

This repository contains a deep learning model trained on the Skin Cancer HAM1000 dataset for skin cancer classification. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to achieve accurate classification of skin lesion images.

## Dataset

The Skin Cancer HAM1000 dataset is a collection of 10015 dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions. The dataset consists of 7 classes, including melanoma, melanocytic nevus, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, benign keratosis-like lesions, dermatofibroma, and vascular lesions.

You can obtain the dataset from [source link](insert_dataset_link).

## Training

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Download the Skin Cancer HAM1000 dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
2. Preprocess the images by resizing them to a shape of 94x94 and increasing the dimension to match the input size expected by the model.
3. Split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Define and configure a CNN model architecture, specifying the desired number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions.
5. Train the model using the preprocessed images and monitor its progress through training epochs.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict skin cancer classes for new images. Follow these steps:

1. Read the image you want to classify.
2. Preprocess the image by resizing it to a shape of 94x94 and increasing the dimension to match the input size expected by the model.
3. Load the trained model weights and architecture.
4. Pass the preprocessed image through the model for prediction.
5. Obtain the predicted class label and associated probabilities.
